# Time-Travel

## OVERVIEW
Bring order to your folders by extracting dates from messy filenames.
Files in the specified path are scanned, and if a date is detected in their names
the file is renamed with YYYY-MM-DD format.
Path can be either absolute or relative.
Folders are immune to renaming.

## USAGE

```bash
time-travel {{path}}
```
